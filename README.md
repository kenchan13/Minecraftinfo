# Minecraft-info

As the original LogiPy is for Python 2.7 , this python file is including the edited version for Python 3.5.
------------
Out goal is to grab the real time information from the Minecraft game.

We've found out that the files would only be changed when the player press the ESC button or temporariliy leaving the game by press the TAB button. Sadly this causes the information inside the files doesn't update as real time.

TODO:
a. Find the process when the ESC button activated behind the game 
b. Try to directly call the process without the player's action
